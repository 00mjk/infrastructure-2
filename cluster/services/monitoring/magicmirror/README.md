# `magicmirror`

## Introduction

Another side project of mine is the construction of one of the well known Magic Mirrors. I've completely written the software for my Magic Mirror by myself as I wanted to explore the Go language.

The software runs on its own Raspberry Pi and this repository only contains the monitoring dashboard for the Magic Mirror. All other code is in its own repository on GitHub: [`pascaliske/magicmirror`](https://github.com/pascaliske/magicmirror/).
